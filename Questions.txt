1. What sort of webserver is it that is being run? (What kind of pages are being served,
does it use any noteworthy configuration etc?)
2. What accesses (or attempted accesses) were benign and what were malicious?
3. Are there different kinds of attack?
4. Can you correlate different attacks, i.e. are certain requests coming from the same
attacker, the same kind of attacker (but another instance, i.e. worm A on computer X and
worm A on computer Y)?
5. Can you differentiate between automated and manual attacks (i.e. a programmed attack
and an attack that has been scripted)? What about the entity behind the attacks, i.e.
automated versus human attacker?
6. Which ten computers (ip-addresses) make the most requests? (Make a frequency plot of
them, i.e. the number of request from the most common source, then second most etc.
What frequency distribution does this look like?)
7. What requests does the most active computer make? How many different kinds?
8. What are they indicative of?
9. If you continue with the second most active computer and so on and remove these
requests, what remain?
10. Anything security relevant/interesting thing that you found and haven’t been asked?
